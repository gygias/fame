your first gig after coming to los angeles with money much smaller than your dreams: generating buzz by following around a local socialite. bodyguard, entourage, errand boy. that's you.

ensure quality entertainment for future generations by elbowing, stomping, and otherwise piledriving anything that stands in your way, while obtaining the kale smoothies and gummy bear edibles you need to stay on top of your game.

the setting is melrose ave. it's crowded. wannabes, skaters, angry drivers, walking dead, and the neverending police helicopters. keep that celebrity safe! knock one thing into the other things for bonus points, and whatever you do, never stop spamming the screen to get bigger combos than the other guy. when your anger meter reaches full, double-swipe up to unleash a devastating buddha chakra something-or-other!
